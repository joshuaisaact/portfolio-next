## The Problem with console.log

Let's be honest - we've all been there. Your Express backend starts misbehaving, so you do what any self-respecting developer would do:

```typescript
console.log("HERE1!!!");
console.log("Data:", someData);
console.log("WHY IS THIS UNDEFINED??");
```

Three months later, you're staring at production logs filled with "HERE1!!!" and wondering what past-you was thinking. It's like leaving passive-aggressive post-it notes for yourself, except less helpful.

## Enter Pino: Structured Logging for Grown-ups

After the third time searching through logs for a "HERE!!!" that could have been anywhere, I decided it was time to be a responsible developer and implement proper logging. Enter Pino, because even [Wooster](https://trywooster.live) needs to keep track of what he's been up to.

## Environment-Aware Logging

First revelation: different environments need different logging approaches. Here's how I set up Wooster's logger:

```typescript
import pino from "pino";

export const logger = pino({
  level:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? "error" : process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info",
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
    ? {
        transport: {
          target: "pino-pretty",
          options: {
            colorize: true,
            translateTime: true,
          },
        },
      }
    : {}),
});
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Test Environment**: Only log errors. Jest output is noisy enough without debug logs.
2. **Development**: Pretty, colorized logs that are actually readable by humans.
3. **Production**: Raw JSON logs - perfect for log aggregation tools.
4. **Configurable Level**: Can be overridden with LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

## The Art of Log Levels

Pino gives us proper log levels, and choosing the right one is more art than science:

```typescript
// Debug: For when you're being extra nosey
logger.debug(
  {
    userId,
    searchParams: req.query,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  "User searching for destinations",
);

// Info: The good stuff you actually want to know about
logger.info(
  {
    tripId,
    destination,
    duration,
    userId,
  },
  "Trip created successfully",
);

// Warn: Something's not quite right...
logger.warn(
  {
    userId,
    attemptCount,
    lastAttemptTime: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  "Multiple failed login attempts detected",
);

// Error: Time to wake up the on-call engineer
logger.error(
  {
    error: {
      message: err.message,
      stack: err.stack,
      code: err.code,
    },
    requestId,
    userId,
  },
  "Failed to generate AI travel plan",
);
```

## Request Context: The Missing Piece

The real power of structured logging comes with context. Here's the middleware I use to track requests:

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";
import { performance } from "perf_hooks";

export const requestLogger = (
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction,
) => {
  const requestId = uuidv4();
  const startTime = performance.now();

  // Attach to request for use in other middlewares
  req.requestId = requestId;

  logger.info(
    {
      requestId,
      method: req.method,
      url: req.url,
      query: req.query,
      userAgent: req.get("user-agent"),
      ip: req.ip,
      // If you have user context from auth
      userId: req.user?.id,
    },
    "Request started",
  );

  // Log when request completes
  res.on("finish", () => {
    const duration = Math.round(performance.now() - startTime);

    logger.info(
      {
        requestId,
        statusCode: res.statusCode,
        duration,
        // Only log response size for successful requests
        ...(res.statusCode < 400 && {
          responseSize: res.get("Content-Length"),
        }),
      },
      "Request completed",
    );
  });

  next();
};
```

## Practical Examples: Real Logs from Wooster

Here's what my logs actually look like in different scenarios:

### Development (using pino-pretty):

```typescript
[2024-11-15 14:23:45.678] INFO: Request started
requestId: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
method: POST
url: /api/trips
userId: auth0|123456
ip: 127.0.0.1

[2024-11-15 14:23:45.890] DEBUG: Generating AI travel plan
requestId: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
destination: "Paris"
duration: 7
preferences: ["culture", "food"]

[2024-11-15 14:23:46.123] INFO: Request completed
requestId: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
statusCode: 201
duration: 445
responseSize: 1234
```

### Production (JSON format):

```json
{
  "level": 30,
  "time": 1673876625678,
  "pid": 1234,
  "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "/api/trips",
  "userId": "auth0|123456",
  "msg": "Request started"
}

{
  "level": 30,
  "time": 1673876626123,
  "pid": 1234,
  "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "statusCode": 201,
  "duration": 445,
  "responseSize": 1234,
  "msg": "Request completed"
}
```

## Real-World Example: Database Service Logging

When I started building Wooster's destination service, I realized logging needs to tell a story. Here's how I approached it:

```typescript
export const getOrCreateDestination = async (location: string) => {
  try {
    try {
      const existingDestination = await fetchDestinationDetailsByName(location);
      logger.info({ location }, "Found existing destination");
      return existingDestination;
    } catch (error) {
      // I'll talk about error handling in the next post. I believe that's called 'creating tension'...
      if (!isServiceError(error) || error.code !== "DB_NOT_FOUND") {
        throw error;
      }
    }

    logger.info({ location }, "Creating new destination");
    const destinationData = await generateDestinationData(location);
    return await addDestination(destinationData);
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};

export const addDestination = (destinationData: NewDestination) =>
  executeDbOperation(
    async () => {
      const [insertedDestination] = await db
        .insert(destinations)
        .values({
          ...destinationData,
          normalizedName: normalizeDestinationName(
            destinationData.destinationName,
          ),
        })
        .returning();

      logger.info({ destinationData }, "Inserted destination successfully");
      return insertedDestination;
    },
    "Failed to insert destination",
    { context: { destinationData } },
  );
```

This creates a breadcrumb trail through the application:

```typescript
[14:23:45.678] INFO: Incoming request
method: POST
url: /api/destinations
location: "Paris"

[14:23:45.789] INFO: Creating new destination
location: "Paris"

[14:23:46.012] INFO: Inserted destination successfully
destinationData: {
destinationName: "Paris",
country: "France",
// ... other fields
}

[14:23:46.123] INFO: Request completed
statusCode: 201
duration: 445ms
```

Key patterns here:

1. Log at service boundaries (entering/exiting key functions)
2. Include relevant business context (location, destination data)
3. Use consistent message formats
4. Track operation progress through the stack

The result? When something goes wrong (and it will), you can trace the exact path through your application. Trust me, at 3 AM when your app is failing, you'll thank yourself for these breadcrumbs.

## Logging Best Practices I've Learned

1. **Be Consistent with Context**

   - Always include requestId
   - Add userId when available
   - Include relevant business context (tripId, destinationId, etc.)

2. **Log Level Selection**

   - Error: Something is broken and needs immediate attention
   - Warn: Something unexpected that might need investigation
   - Info: Normal business events you want to track
   - Debug: Detailed information for development/troubleshooting

3. **Security Considerations**

   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
   - Be careful with PII (personally identifiable information)
   - Consider GDPR implications of what you're logging

4. **Performance Impact**
   - Use appropriate log levels to control output
   - Consider log rotation in production
   - Be mindful of log size (especially with stack traces)

## What I Actually Learned

1. Structured logging isn't just about pretty output - it's about being able to trace issues across requests
2. Environment-specific configuration is crucial
3. Context is king - the more relevant context you add, the easier debugging becomes
4. Good logging practices save hours of debugging time
5. Your future self will thank you (mine already has)

## What's Next?

Now that I can properly track what's happening in my application, it's time to handle what happens when things go wrong. But that's a story for another post about error handling...

And once we've got error handling sorted, we'll look at how to get these lovely structured logs into a proper monitoring system - because as nice as JSON logs are, they're even better when you can query and visualize them. But one thing at a time...

# Planning the architecture

After getting my database schema sorted and teaching Wooster to generate coherent travel plans, it was time to build the API. But before writing a single endpoint, I wanted to get the architecture right.

## Starting with Structure

While it's tempting to throw everything into a single `server.ts` file when prototyping (I've been burned by that before), I decided to be a responsible developer and set up a proper MVC structure from the start:

```
src/
├── controllers/        # Request handlers by resource
├── models/            # Database client and models
├── services/          # Business logic and external services
├── routes/            # Route definitions
├── types/            # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── utils/            # Shared utilities
├── middleware/       # Express middleware
└── config/           # Configuration and constants
```

This might seem like overkill for an MVP, but past-me has burned present-me too many times with "I'll restructure it later."

## The MVP Endpoints

For the initial version, I kept it simple:

```typescript
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

// Destination routes
router.get("/destinations", handleGetDestinations);
router.get("/destination/:destinationName", handleGetDestinationByName);

// Trip routes
router.post("/trips", handleAddTrip);
router.get("/trips/:id", handleGetTrip);

export default router;
```

But the real magic wasn't in the routes - it was in how I handled them. Take adding a destination, for example:

## Separation of Concerns in Action

Instead of stuffing everything into route handlers, each piece had its place:

```typescript
// controllers/destinations/add-destination.ts
export const handleAddDestination = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { destination } = req.body;

    if (!destination?.trim()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Destination is required" });
    }

    const existingDestination = await findDestinationByName(destination);

    if (existingDestination) {
      return res.status(200).json({ destination: existingDestination });
    }

    // Generate new destination data using AI
    const destinationData = await generateNewDestination(destination);
    const newDestination = await addDestination(destinationData);

    return res.status(201).json({
      message: "Destination created successfully",
      destination: newDestination,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    const { status, message } = handleControllerError(error);
    return res.status(status).json({ error: message });
  }
};
```

The controller only handled the HTTP layer - all the business logic lived in services:

```typescript
// services/destination-service/destination-generator.ts
export const generateNewDestination = async (
  destinationName: string,
): Promise<NewDestination> => {
  try {
    const prompt = destinationPromptTemplate(destinationName);
    const generatedDestination = await generateAIData(prompt);

    if (!generatedDestination) {
      throw new ServiceError("Failed to generate destination data", 500);
    }

    const destinationData = JSON.parse(generatedDestination);
    if (!destinationData?.destinationName) {
      throw new ServiceError("Invalid destination data format", 500);
    }

    return destinationData;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ServiceError) throw error;
    throw new ServiceError("Failed to generate destination data", 500);
  }
};
```

## Evolution: Adding User Features

Once I actually implemented auth (post-MVP) I realised in my testing that we would also need a separate saved destinations table. This meant adding new endpoints:

```typescript
// New routes for saved destinations
router.get("/saved-destinations", requireAuth, handleGetSavedDestinations);
router.post(
  "/saved-destinations/:destinationId",
  requireAuth,
  handleAddSavedDestination,
);
```

(The authentication story deserves its own article - let's just say Supabase made it much less painful than it could have been!)

## What I Actually Learned

1. Start with good architecture - moving files is harder than creating them
2. Controllers should be thin - business logic belongs in services
3. Type everything from the start - TypeScript is your friend
4. Error handling deserves attention early - users don't appreciate raw error stacks
5. Organize by feature, not function - keeps related code together
6. CORS configuration is always trickier than you expect
7. Log everything in development

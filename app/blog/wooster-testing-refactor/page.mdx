## Evolution of Testing Approaches in Modern Express Apps

### The Traditional Approach

Traditionally, testing Express APIs often involved using Supertest to make HTTP requests to your endpoints:

```typescript
// Old approach with Supertest
request(app)
  .get("/api/destinations")
  .expect(200)
  .then((response) => {
    expect(response.body).toEqual(expectedData);
  });
```

## The Modern Approach

However, in modern apps that heavily rely on external services (like Supabase, AWS, etc.), this approach has limitations:

1. Unit/Integration Testing:

- Use Jest + MSW to test your business logic
- Mock external service calls (auth, databases, APIs)
- Focus on testing the logic, not the HTTP layer

2. End-to-End Testing:

- Use Playwright/Cypress for comprehensive e2e tests
- Test the entire flow including real API calls
- Run against a test environment

## Why This Evolution Makes Sense

1. Modern apps often have complex external dependencies
2. Testing HTTP endpoints in isolation is less valuable than testing complete flows
3. MSW provides a better developer experience for mocking external services
4. End-to-end tests provide more confidence in the entire system
